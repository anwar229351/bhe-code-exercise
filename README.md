# Step-by-Step Implementation
# Step 1: Research and Plan
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer. The idea is to iteratively mark the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.

# Step 2: Implement the Sieve Algorithm
We'll implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes and create an API to get the Nth prime number.

# Step 3: Create a Test Suite
We'll write tests to verify the implementation.

#Running the Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command:
# python -m unittest test_sieve.py
